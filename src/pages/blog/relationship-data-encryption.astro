<p>
  You share your most intimate thoughts, photos, and plans with your partner through apps. The late-night "I miss you" messages. The photos from your weekend away. The shared calendar that maps out your life together. But have you ever stopped to wonder who else can see all of it?
</p>

<p>
  If you are using a typical couples or relationship app, the answer might unsettle you. Your private moments may not be as private as you think.
</p>

<h2>The Problem: Most Relationship Apps Fail Privacy</h2>

<p>
  In a widely cited study, Mozilla's <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">*Privacy Not Included</a> research team reviewed 25 popular dating and relationship apps. The result was damning: <strong>22 out of 25 apps earned a "Privacy Not Included" warning</strong> -- meaning they failed to meet basic privacy and security standards.
</p>

<p>
  That is not a fringe finding. It means the vast majority of apps that couples trust with their most personal data are handling it irresponsibly. Here is what many of these apps were caught doing:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Collecting far more data than necessary</strong> -- location history, contact lists, browsing habits, and device information that has nothing to do with the app's core features.</li>
  <li><strong>Selling or sharing data with advertisers</strong> and third-party data brokers, turning your relationship into a revenue stream.</li>
  <li><strong>Storing messages and photos unencrypted</strong> on their servers, meaning employees, contractors, or hackers could potentially access them.</li>
  <li><strong>Suffering data breaches</strong> that exposed intimate conversations, personal photos, and real-world identities of users.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The relationship app category has one of the worst privacy track records in the entire app ecosystem. And yet, by nature, these apps hold some of the most sensitive data imaginable.
</p>

<h2>What Your Couples App Knows About You</h2>

<p>
  Take a moment to think about everything you share inside a couples app. It is not just a few casual messages. It is a comprehensive portrait of your relationship and your life:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Messages</strong> -- your arguments, your apologies, your declarations of love, your most vulnerable moments. The things you would never say in public.</li>
  <li><strong>Photos</strong> -- personal and intimate pictures, from everyday selfies to moments you only want one other person to see.</li>
  <li><strong>Calendar and events</strong> -- where you will be and when, your routines, your travel plans, your date nights.</li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong> -- shared passwords, home addresses, medical information, financial details, future plans.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage patterns</strong> -- when you message, how often, what times you are active, the rhythm of your relationship.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Combined, this data is more intimate than what most people share with their therapist, their doctor, or their closest friends. It is a near-complete map of your emotional and personal life. And in the wrong hands -- whether through a data breach, a rogue employee, or a corporate acquisition -- it becomes a serious liability.
</p>

<h2>What Encryption Actually Means</h2>

<p>
  When an app encrypts your data, it transforms your messages, photos, and notes into unreadable code that can only be decoded with the right key. Without that key, your content is meaningless gibberish -- even if someone gains access to the server where it is stored.
</p>

<p>
  This matters because many apps do not encrypt your content at all. Your messages and photos sit on their servers in plain text, readable by anyone with database access -- employees, contractors, or hackers who breach the system.
</p>

<p>
  A privacy-respecting app should encrypt <strong>all</strong> content -- not just text messages, but photos, notes, events, and any other data you store. Some apps claim encryption but only apply it partially, leaving images or metadata exposed. That distinction matters.
</p>

<h2>Why "We Won't Look" Is Not Good Enough</h2>

<p>
  Some app companies will tell you: "We have your data on our servers, but we promise not to look at it." That sounds reassuring. It is not. Here is why a promise is fundamentally weaker than a technical guarantee:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Companies change hands.</strong> The startup that built your favorite couples app today could be acquired by a data-hungry corporation tomorrow. When ownership changes, privacy commitments often change with it. Your data stays behind, now governed by a completely different set of values.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Employees have access.</strong> If data is stored unencrypted (or encrypted with keys the company holds), any employee, contractor, or system administrator with the right credentials can access it. Insider threats are not hypothetical -- they are a well-documented reality across the tech industry.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Governments can compel disclosure.</strong> Legal subpoenas, court orders, and national security requests can force companies to hand over user data. If the company stores your messages in plain text, they can be legally required to share them.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Breaches happen to everyone.</strong> No company is immune to data breaches, no matter how large or well-funded. Major corporations with billions in security budgets have been breached. A smaller app company with fewer resources is arguably at greater risk. If your data is stored in plaintext or with server-side keys, a breach exposes everything.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p>
    <strong>The best privacy promise is a technical one:</strong> encryption that protects your data at rest and in transit, combined with a business model that has no incentive to monetize your content.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>What to Look for in a Private Couples App</h2>

<p>
  Not all privacy claims are created equal. Before trusting an app with your relationship's most personal moments, run through this checklist:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Does it encrypt your data?</strong> Not just in transit, but at rest on the server. If your messages and photos sit unencrypted in a database, a single breach exposes everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Does it encrypt both text and media?</strong> Some apps encrypt messages but leave photos, files, and metadata unprotected. Your images deserve the same protection as your words.</li>
  <li><strong>What is the company's business model?</strong> If the app is free and ad-supported, your data is the product. A paid subscription model means the company makes money from the product, not from selling your information.</li>
  <li><strong>Does it collect unnecessary data?</strong> A couples app does not need your precise location, your contact list, or your browsing history. If it asks for these permissions, question why.</li>
  <li><strong>Does it show ads?</strong> Advertising-supported apps have a financial incentive to track you. Ads require data -- your data -- to be effective. An ad-free model is a strong privacy signal.</li>
  <li><strong>Is there a clear, readable privacy policy?</strong> If the privacy policy is 30 pages of legalese, that is usually by design. A privacy-respecting company should be able to explain its practices in plain language.</li>
  <li><strong>Can you delete your data permanently?</strong> You should be able to erase your account and all associated data at any time, with confidence that the deletion is real and complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If an app fails on more than one of these criteria, it is worth reconsidering whether you want to trust it with the most personal details of your relationship.
</p>

<h2>How OurCouple Handles Privacy</h2>

<p>
  We built OurCouple specifically because we believed couples deserved better than the privacy status quo. Here is how we approach it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>All content is encrypted</strong> -- messages, notes, photos, events, daily messages. Not just text, not just some features. All of it.</li>
  <li><strong>No ads, no tracking, no data selling.</strong> Our business model is a straightforward premium subscription. We make money from the product, not from your data.</li>
  <li><strong>No unnecessary permissions.</strong> We only request access to what the app genuinely needs to function. No location tracking. No contact list access.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We are not the only app that cares about privacy, and we encourage you to evaluate every app -- including ours -- against the checklist above. But we are confident in the technical foundation we have built, and we believe the standard for relationship apps needs to be much higher than where it is today.
</p>

<h2>Your Relationship Deserves Better</h2>

<p>
  Your relationship is the most personal thing in your life. The conversations you have with your partner, the photos you share, the plans you make together -- these are not data points to be harvested, analyzed, or monetized. They are private moments that belong to the two of you and no one else.
</p>

<p>
  The app you choose to trust with those moments should treat them accordingly. Not with promises and privacy policies that can change with the next funding round, but with real encryption and a business model aligned with your privacy.
</p>

<p>
  When 22 out of 25 relationship apps fail basic privacy standards, choosing the right one is not a minor detail. It is one of the most important decisions you can make for your digital life together.
</p>

<p>
  Choose an app that encrypts your data and has no reason to exploit it -- not one that simply says it will not.
