<p>
  At some point in every relationship, the question pops up: <strong>how long have we been dating?</strong> Maybe you are lying in bed on a quiet Sunday morning, or maybe your partner just asked and you realize you are not entirely sure. You know the year. You think you remember the month. But exactly how many days, weeks, or months have you been together?
</p>

<p>
  It sounds like a simple question, but it opens the door to something meaningful. Knowing exactly how long you have been together turns an ordinary Tuesday into a reason to celebrate. It helps you recognize milestones you might have missed — and gives you an excuse to be intentional about appreciating the time you have built together.
</p>

<p>
  In this guide, we will show you how to calculate your relationship length down to the exact day, walk through every milestone worth celebrating, and share creative ways to mark each one. And if you just want the quick answer, our free <a href="/tools/anniversary-calculator" class="text-primary hover:underline">anniversary calculator</a> will do the math for you in seconds.

<h2>Calculate How Long You Have Been Dating</h2>

<p>
  The fastest way to find out exactly how long you have been together is to use a dedicated <a href="/tools/anniversary-calculator" class="text-primary hover:underline">anniversary calculator</a>. Just enter the date your relationship started and you will instantly see your relationship length in days, weeks, months, and years — plus a list of upcoming milestones you can look forward to.
</p>

<p>
  No mental math required. No opening a calendar app and counting squares. Just a clear, accurate answer to the question <strong>"how long have we been together?"</strong> — and a reminder that every single day counts.
</p>

<p>
  If you prefer to understand the math behind it, or if you are not sure which date to use as your starting point, keep reading.
</p>

<h2>How to Count Relationship Days</h2>

<p>
  Counting the number of days in your relationship is straightforward in theory: take today's date, subtract your start date, and you have your answer. But in practice, there are two questions that trip couples up.
</p>

<h3>The Math</h3>

<p>
  To calculate how long you have been dating manually, you need the number of days between your start date and today. Here is the basic approach:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Count the number of full years between your start date and today, and multiply by 365 (add one extra day for each leap year).</li>
  <li>Count the remaining full months and add the appropriate number of days for each month (28, 30, or 31).</li>
  <li>Add the remaining days.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For example, if your start date is March 15, 2023, and today is February 10, 2026, that is 2 years, 10 months, and 26 days — or roughly 1,063 days. The exact number depends on leap years and month lengths, which is why a <a href="/tools/anniversary-calculator" class="text-primary hover:underline">dating calculator</a> is so much easier than doing it by hand.
</p>

<h3>What Counts as Your Start Date?</h3>

<p>
  This is where things get personal. Couples define their "start date" differently, and there is no single right answer. Here are the most common options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Your first date.</strong> The day you first went out together, even if you were not officially a couple yet. Many people use this because it marks the very beginning of the story.</li>
  <li><strong>The day you became official.</strong> The moment you had "the talk" and agreed you were in a relationship. This is the most traditional choice and what most anniversary calculators default to.</li>
  <li><strong>The day you met.</strong> Some couples use the day they first crossed paths, especially if the connection was instant. This is common for couples who met through friends, at an event, or in a memorable setting.</li>
  <li><strong>The day you said "I love you."</strong> Less common, but some couples mark this as the real starting point of their deeper commitment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The best answer is whichever date feels meaningful to both of you. If you and your partner disagree, you can always track both — our <a href="/tools/anniversary-calculator" class="text-primary hover:underline">anniversary calculator</a> lets you enter any date and see all the milestones from that point forward.
</p>

<h2>Relationship Milestones Worth Celebrating</h2>

<p>
  Once you know exactly how long you have been dating, you will start noticing milestones everywhere. Some are classic anniversaries. Others are quirky day-count celebrations that have become popular around the world. Here is a comprehensive list of every <strong>relationship milestone</strong> worth marking on your calendar.
</p>

<h3>Early Milestones (First Year)</h3>

<p>
  The first year is packed with firsts and small victories. These early milestones feel especially significant because you are still building the foundation of your relationship.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>30 days (1 month).</strong> Your first full month together. It might seem small, but it is worth a moment of acknowledgment — a sweet text, a small gesture, or simply saying "happy one month."</li>
  <li><strong>90 days (3 months).</strong> Often called the end of the "honeymoon phase." If you are still excited about each other at three months, that is a great sign. This is a natural moment to reflect on how far you have come.</li>
  <li><strong>100 days.</strong> A satisfying round number that has become a popular celebration in many cultures (more on that below). One hundred days is long enough to feel real and short enough to still feel new.</li>
  <li><strong>6 months (roughly 182 days).</strong> The half-year mark. By now you have likely met each other's friends, navigated a disagreement or two, and started building real routines together. Six months is a genuine milestone.</li>
  <li><strong>1 year (365 days).</strong> Your first anniversary. This is the big one for new couples — a full year of choosing each other every day. Celebrate it well. You have earned it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cultural Milestones</h3>

<p>
  Different cultures have their own special relationship milestones. Even if these traditions are not part of your heritage, they are beautiful reasons to celebrate.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>100 days — Korean Baegil.</strong> In South Korea, the 100th day of a relationship (<em>baegil</em>) is a major celebration. Couples exchange gifts, go on special dates, and mark the occasion with as much importance as a yearly anniversary. The tradition comes from the cultural significance of 100 days in Korean life — it is also celebrated for babies.</li>
  <li><strong>200 days and 300 days.</strong> In Korean dating culture, every 100-day increment is an occasion. Couples often celebrate 200 days, 300 days, and so on, each with its own small ritual or gift exchange.</li>
  <li><strong>520 days — Chinese "I Love You."</strong> In Mandarin Chinese, the number 520 (<em>wu er ling</em>) sounds similar to "I love you" (<em>wo ai ni</em>). Reaching 520 days together has become a romantic milestone, especially among younger couples in China. May 20th (5/20) is also celebrated as a kind of Valentine's Day for the same reason.</li>
  <li><strong>777 days — Lucky Number.</strong> The number 7 is considered lucky in many cultures around the world. Reaching 777 days together feels like a sign that your relationship is blessed. Some couples use it as an excuse for a particularly special date or a meaningful gift.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Big Number Milestones</h3>

<p>
  There is something deeply satisfying about reaching a big, round number. These milestones are not tied to any particular tradition — they are just impressive.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>500 days.</strong> If you have seen the movie <em>500 Days of Summer</em>, this number carries extra meaning. Five hundred days is about a year and four months — long enough to know this is not a fling, short enough that everything still feels relatively fresh.</li>
  <li><strong>1,000 days.</strong> Just under three years. Reaching four digits together is a legitimate achievement. It means you have been through seasons, holidays, challenges, and growth — and you are still here.</li>
  <li><strong>1,500 days.</strong> Roughly four years. By now you have built a real life together. This is a great moment to look back at how much has changed since day one.</li>
  <li><strong>2,000 days.</strong> About five and a half years. Two thousand days of choosing the same person is extraordinary. If you have made it this far, your relationship has weathered real life — and that is worth celebrating.</li>
  <li><strong>3,000 days.</strong> Just over eight years. At this point, your relationship has likely survived moves, career changes, and maybe even major life events like getting married or having kids. Three thousand days is a testament to your commitment.</li>
  <li><strong>5,000 days.</strong> Almost fourteen years. This is a milestone that very few couples track, but reaching it is a quiet kind of extraordinary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Anniversary Milestones</h3>

<p>
  Yearly anniversaries are the milestones most people know. What many couples do not know is that each anniversary year has a traditional name and material associated with it — a custom that dates back centuries. Here are the most notable ones:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1 year — Paper.</strong> Your first anniversary. The traditional gift is paper, symbolizing the blank page your story is being written on. Think love letters, a journal, concert tickets, or a book that is meaningful to you both.</li>
  <li><strong>2 years — Cotton.</strong> Comfortable, flexible, and strong. Cotton represents the growing comfort of your relationship. Think matching shirts, a cozy blanket, or quality bedding.</li>
  <li><strong>3 years — Leather.</strong> Durable and only gets better with age. A leather journal, wallet, or bag makes a thoughtful gift.</li>
  <li><strong>5 years — Wood.</strong> Deep roots and lasting strength. Wooden gifts like a custom cutting board, a piece of art, or a tree planted together symbolize a relationship that is built to last.</li>
  <li><strong>10 years — Tin or Aluminum.</strong> A full decade together. The traditional material represents resilience and flexibility — a relationship that bends but does not break.</li>
  <li><strong>15 years — Crystal.</strong> Clear, precious, and refined by time. Crystal represents the clarity and transparency that comes from over a decade of partnership.</li>
  <li><strong>20 years — China.</strong> Elegant and beautiful, but requiring care. Twenty years of marriage is a milestone that many couples celebrate with a significant trip or event.</li>
  <li><strong>25 years — Silver.</strong> The Silver Anniversary. A quarter century together is a monumental achievement. Silver represents the brilliance and value of a long-lasting partnership.</li>
  <li><strong>30 years — Pearl.</strong> Pearls are formed slowly, layer by layer, through patience and time — just like a 30-year relationship.</li>
  <li><strong>40 years — Ruby.</strong> Deep, passionate, and rare. Forty years of love is something truly exceptional.</li>
  <li><strong>50 years — Gold.</strong> The Gold Anniversary. Half a century of shared life. This is the milestone that families gather for, that communities celebrate, and that represents the very best of what long-term love can be.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun Ways to Celebrate Your Milestones</h2>

<p>
  Knowing your milestones is one thing. Actually celebrating them is what makes them meaningful. Here are some ideas for marking the occasion, whether you are celebrating 100 days or 10 years.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Recreate your first date.</strong> Go back to the same restaurant, watch the same movie, or walk the same route. Doing something familiar with fresh eyes is one of the most romantic things you can do.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Write each other a letter.</strong> Put down in words what the last milestone period has meant to you. A handwritten letter costs nothing and means everything. If you want to keep a running record, start a shared journal using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6758024356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary hover:underline">OurCouple's shared notes</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Take a photo in the same spot every year.</strong> Pick a meaningful location — where you met, where you had your first kiss, your front door — and take a photo there on every anniversary. Over time, the collection becomes priceless.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plan a surprise date night at home.</strong> You do not need to leave the house to celebrate well. Cook a special meal, light candles, and put your phones away. Need inspiration? Check out our list of <a href="/blog/free-date-night-ideas" class="text-primary hover:underline">50 free date night ideas at home</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Take a trip together.</strong> Even a short day trip or overnight getaway can make a milestone feel special. The point is to step outside your routine and create a new memory together.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Learn something new about each other.</strong> Take our free <a href="/tools/love-language" class="text-primary hover:underline">love language quiz</a> to discover how your partner prefers to give and receive love, or try our <a href="/tools/couple-quiz" class="text-primary hover:underline">couple quiz</a> to test how well you really know each other. Milestones are the perfect time to go deeper.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Give a gift that matches the milestone.</strong> Use the traditional anniversary materials as inspiration. Paper for year one, wood for year five, silver for year twenty-five. Having a theme makes gift-giving more creative and more personal.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Never Miss a Milestone</h2>
